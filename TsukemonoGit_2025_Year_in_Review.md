# 2025: A Year of Building and Connecting in the Nostr Ecosystem

As we look back at 2025, the activity profile of **TsukemonoGit** (mono) tells a story of incredible focus, technical craftsmanship, and a deep commitment to the decentralized web. This wasn't just a year of "writing code"—it was a year of building bridges through the Nostr protocol, with over **58,000 posts** and **50,000 interactions** marking a milestone in digital engagement.

## The Heart of the Work: lumilumi
If 2025 had a centerpiece, it was undeniably **[lumilumi](https://github.com/TsukemonoGit/lumilumi)**. With a staggering **1,781 commits**, this project was the pulse of mono's developer journey. As a Nostr web client, lumilumi represents a significant effort to refine user experience in a complex, burgeoning ecosystem. The sheer volume of work here suggests not just maintenance, but a continuous evolution of features and polish.

## A Multifaceted Ecosystem
The year was also marked by a broader vision. Beyond the main client, monocentric development branched out into several key areas:
- **Automation & Interaction:** The **[nostr-monoGazo-bot](https://github.com/TsukemonoGit/nostr-monoGazo-bot)** (359 commits) and **[nostr-iroiro-bot](https://github.com/TsukemonoGit/nostr-iroiro-bot)** show a keen interest in how automated agents can enrich the Nostr experience.
- **Developer Tools:** The creation of **[nostr-web-components](https://github.com/TsukemonoGit/nostr-web-components)** and **[nostr-content-parser](https://github.com/TsukemonoGit/nostr-content-parser)** reveals a "build-for-others" mindset, providing the LEGO bricks that other developers need to build their own visions.
- **Narrative & Expression:** Projects like **[longFormEditor](https://github.com/TsukemonoGit/longFormEditor)** (makimono) highlight a focus on long-form content, moving beyond short notes into the realm of digital literature.

## The Rhythm of Development
2025 was a marathon, not a sprint, but it certainly had its peaks. The **summer of 2025** saw an extraordinary surge in productivity, with **July (801 contributions)** and **August (664 contributions)** marking a period of intense creative output. Even as the year wound down, the momentum remained steady, closing out December with over 260 contributions.

## By the Numbers
- **Total Contributions:** 4,720
- **Daily Average:** ~13 contributions per day
- **Nostr Activity:** 58,089 posts, 50,279 interactions (48,376 reactions, 1,516 reposts, 387 zaps)
- **Primary stack:** Svelte, TypeScript, and a dash of Python.

## Looking Forward
TsukemonoGit’s 2025 was a masterclass in consistency. By focusing on the Nostr protocol and modern web technologies like Svelte, mono has not only built tools but has helped shape the culture of a new kind of internet. 

In 2025, the code spoke for itself. In 2026, we can expect that voice to grow even stronger.
